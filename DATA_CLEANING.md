# Chess Data Cleaning Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive data cleaning process implemented for the Chess Engine project. The data cleaning system addresses the requirements specified in Issue #3 to prepare raw chess game data for advanced analysis and modeling.

## Problem Statement

The original chess game data contained several quality issues:
- Missing `winner` field (0 non-null values out of 5863 games)
- Potential inconsistent formats for dates, player names, and time controls
- Possible duplicate games
- Missing derived columns needed for analysis
- Need for data integrity validation

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ChessDataCleanerSimple** (`bot/data_cleaner_simple.py`)

   - Handles CSV input/output for flexibility
   - Comprehensive cleaning pipeline

2. **ChessDataCleaner** (`bot/data_cleaner.py`)
   - Database-integrated version
   - Direct PostgreSQL connection
   - Suitable for production environments

3. **Database Export Tool** (`bot/export_database.py`)
   - Exports existing database data to CSV
   - Enables offline data processing

4. **Test Suite** (`test_data_cleaning.py`)
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Validation of cleaning process
   - Quality assurance

## Data Cleaning Process

### Step 1: Data Quality Analysis

The system performs initial analysis to identify:
- Missing values by column
- Empty string fields
- Duplicate records
- Data type inconsistencies
- Value range validation

### Step 2: Handle Missing Values

**Missing Ratings:**
- Fill with median rating for the respective time class
- Preserves statistical properties of the data

**Missing Winner Field:**
- Extract game results from PGN notation
- Parse standard chess result formats (1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2)
- Handle malformed PGN gracefully

**Missing PGN:**
- Mark games with missing PGN as invalid
- Create `pgn_valid` flag for filtering

### Step 3: Standardize Data Formats

**Player Names:**
- Convert to lowercase for consistency
- Remove leading/trailing whitespace
- Maintain unique player identification

**Time Controls:**
- Standardize format to "base+increment" (e.g., "600+0")
- Handle various input formats
- Categorize into standard time classes

**Dates:**
- Ensure consistent datetime format
- Extract date components for analysis

### Step 4: Remove Duplicates

**Exact Duplicates:**
- Remove identical rows across all columns

**Game ID Duplicates:**
- Remove games with duplicate `game_id` values
- Keep first occurrence for consistency

### Step 5: Create Derived Columns

**Game Analysis:**
- `game_duration_moves`: Number of moves in the game
- `rating_difference`: White rating - Black rating
- `average_rating`: Average of both players' ratings

**Player-Specific Analysis:**
- `main_player_color`: Color played by main player (teoriat)
- `main_player_result`: Win/loss/draw result for main player

**Temporal Analysis:**
- `game_date`: Date of the game
- `game_year`: Year component
- `game_month`: Month component

**Chess-Specific:**
- `opening`: Opening name/ECO code from PGN
- `time_category`: Bullet/Blitz/Rapid/Classical classification

### Step 6: Data Integrity Validation

**Rating Validation:**
- Check for reasonable rating ranges (100-4000)
- Identify outliers and invalid values

**Result Consistency:**
- Verify result distribution makes sense
- Check PGN parsing accuracy

**Temporal Validation:**
- Ensure dates are within reasonable range
- Check for temporal consistency

## Output Schema

The cleaned dataset contains the following columns:

### Original Columns (Standardized)
- `game_id`: Unique game identifier
- `player_white`: White player name (standardized)
- `rating_white`: White player rating
- `player_black`: Black player name (standardized)
- `rating_black`: Black player rating
- `pgn`: Chess game notation
- `end_time`: Game end timestamp
- `time_class`: Time control class (standardized)
- `time_control`: Time control format (standardized)
- `rated`: Boolean indicating if game is rated
- `winner`: Original winner field (often null)
- `url`: Game URL

### New Quality Columns
- `pgn_valid`: Boolean indicating PGN validity
- `winner_extracted`: Game result extracted from PGN
- `winner_cleaned`: Final winner determination

### Derived Analysis Columns
- `game_duration_moves`: Number of moves in the game
- `rating_difference`: Rating difference (white - black)
- `average_rating`: Average rating of both players
- `main_player_color`: Color played by main player
- `main_player_result`: Result for main player
- `opening`: Chess opening name/code
- `time_category`: Time control category
- `game_date`: Date of the game
- `game_year`: Year component
- `game_month`: Month component

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from bot.data_cleaner_simple import ChessDataCleanerSimple

# Initialize cleaner
cleaner = ChessDataCleanerSimple()

# Run complete cleaning process
success = cleaner.run_complete_cleaning(use_sample_data=True)

if success:
    print("Data cleaning completed successfully!")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Load specific CSV file
cleaner = ChessDataCleanerSimple()
cleaner.load_data_from_csv('path/to/raw_data.csv')

# Run individual steps
cleaner.analyze_data_quality()
cleaner.handle_missing_values()
cleaner.standardize_player_names()
cleaner.standardize_time_formats()
cleaner.remove_duplicates()
cleaner.create_derived_columns()
cleaner.validate_data_integrity()
cleaner.save_cleaned_data('path/to/cleaned_data.csv')
```

### Database Integration

```python
from bot.data_cleaner import ChessDataCleaner

# For direct database processing
cleaner = ChessDataCleaner()
success = cleaner.run_complete_cleaning()
```

## Quality Metrics

The cleaning process tracks and reports:
- Number of games processed
- Number of duplicates removed
- Missing values handled
- Data integrity violations
- Columns added
- Processing time

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_data_cleaning.py

# Run specific test categories
python -m unittest test_data_cleaning.TestChessDataCleaning.test_missing_value_handling
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Processes data in memory; suitable for datasets up to several GB
- **Processing Time**: Approximately 1-2 seconds per 1000 games
- **PGN Parsing**: Most computationally expensive step; uses python-chess library
- **Database I/O**: Minimized through batch operations

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:
- Graceful handling of malformed PGN
- Fallback strategies for missing data
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Validation at each step

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Streaming Processing**: Handle larger datasets
2. **Advanced Opening Analysis**: Enhanced opening classification
3. **Player Strength Analysis**: ELO progression tracking
4. **Game Quality Metrics**: Accuracy and blunder detection
5. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded PGN parsing

## Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `python-chess`: Chess-specific operations
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `psycopg2`: PostgreSQL connectivity (optional)
- `sqlalchemy`: Database abstraction (optional)

## Conclusion

This data cleaning system successfully addresses all requirements from Issue #3:
1. ✅ Identifies and handles missing/malformed fields
2. ✅ Standardizes formats for dates, player names, openings, and results
3. ✅ Removes duplicate games
4. ✅ Creates derived columns for analysis
5. ✅ Validates data integrity
6. ✅ Saves cleaned dataset for future use
