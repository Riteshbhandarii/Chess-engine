## 💡 Introduction

This project aims to build a **chess bot** that mirrors my own playstyle and continuously improves over time. The bot is designed to analyze my past games and adopt my strategies, including opening moves, tactical patterns, and decision-making processes. As I play against the bot, it learns and adapts, becoming increasingly challenging by incorporating my own strengths and weaknesses.

The core idea is to create a chess bot that *plays like me*, by leveraging data from my previous games to mimic my moves and adapt to my strategy. I will be developing my own AI model to power this bot and improve its decision-making over time.

## 🔑 Features

- **Adaptation**: The bot learns and improves after each game played against me, evolving with each new match.
- **Opening Strategy**: Based on my historical games, the bot adopts my opening moves and plays them intelligently.
- **Personalized Playstyle**: The bot's playstyle mimics my behavior, including how I approach different positions.
- **Custom AI Model**: I will be developing my own AI model for the bot, tailored to my playstyle and improving over time.
- **Unity Integration**: The chess game is built using Unity for real-time gameplay and smooth interactions.
- **AI and Chess Engine**: Uses a combination of my AI model and a chess engine (like Stockfish) to evaluate positions and suggest the best moves.
