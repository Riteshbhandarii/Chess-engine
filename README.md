## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

This project aims to build a **chess bot** that mirrors your own playstyle and continuously improves over time. The bot is designed to analyze your past games and adopt your strategies, including opening moves, tactical patterns, and decision-making processes. As you play against the bot, it learns and adapts, becoming increasingly challenging by incorporating your own strengths and weaknesses.

The core idea is to create a chess bot that *plays like you*, by leveraging data from your previous games to mimic your moves and adapt to your strategy.

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- **Adaptation**: The bot learns and improves after each game played against you, evolving with each new match.
- **Opening Strategy**: Based on your historical games, the bot adopts your opening moves and plays them intelligently.
- **Personalized Playstyle**: The bot's playstyle mimics your behavior, including how you approach different positions.
- **Unity Integration**: The chess game is built using Unity for real-time gameplay and smooth interactions.
- **AI and Chess Engine**: Uses a combination of AI models and a chess engine (like Stockfish) to evaluate positions and suggest the best moves.
